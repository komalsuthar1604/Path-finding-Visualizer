# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Overview

This project is an interactive **Pathfinding Visualizer** built using **React**. It demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms work by visualizing their step-by-step execution on a grid. Users can create walls, set start and end nodes, and observe how different algorithms explore the grid to find the shortest path.

This project is developed as a **learning-based and customizable implementation** inspired by Clement Mihailescu’s Pathfinding Visualizer concept. The codebase has been adapted and extended to serve as a standalone project suitable for academic learning, experimentation, and portfolio use.

## Features

* Interactive grid-based UI
* Visualization of pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, A*)
* Real-time animation of algorithm execution
* Wall and obstacle placement
* Clear path and reset grid options

---

## Project Structure

* `src/PathfindingVisualizer` – Core visualizer component responsible for grid rendering and UI logic
* `src/algorithms` – Implementations of pathfinding algorithms
* `App.js` – Entry point where the PathfindingVisualizer component is imported and rendered

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application will run in development mode at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. The page reloads automatically on code changes and displays lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder with optimized and minified assets.

### `npm run eject`

Ejects the Create React App configuration. **This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.**

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* HTML5 & CSS3
* Create React App

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Understanding graph traversal and shortest-path algorithms
* Practical experience with React component-based architecture
* Improved knowledge of state management and UI rendering

---

## Acknowledgement

This project is inspired by the Pathfinding Visualizer tutorial and educational content created by **Clement Mihailescu**. The implementation has been modified and structured independently for learning and development purposes.
